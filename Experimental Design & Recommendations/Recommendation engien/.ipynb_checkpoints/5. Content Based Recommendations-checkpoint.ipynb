There are a number of things we still could look into - how do our collaborative filtering and content based recommendations compare to one another?

How can we truly gain recommendations for every user?\n",

You might choose to make the final needed recommendations using the first technique with just top ranked movies.  You might also loosen up the strictness in the similarity needed between movies.
